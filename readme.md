## LBQPtools


This Shiny App consists of a collection of tools that have been created to solve daily problems we have encountered in our lab. The idea of using Shiny is that we can take advantage of all R's powerful features for the most different tasks, as well as easily share them with cowokers and other researchers.

This tool also links to NetWheels, a separate Shiny App that is also hosted here on Github.
