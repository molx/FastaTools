## LBQPtools


This Shiny App consists of a collection of tools that have been created to solve daily problems we have encountered in [our lab](http://lbqp.unb.br/). The idea of using Shiny is that we can take advantage of all [R Language](https://www.r-project.org/)'s powerful features for the most different tasks, as well as easily share them with cowokers and other researchers.

The app is available at http://lbqp.unb.br/LBQPtools/

This tool also links to [NetWheels](http://lbqp.unb.br/NetWheels/), a separate Shiny App that is also hosted here on Github. 

These tools have been developed by Alan R. MÃ³l under the supervision of Prof. Wagner Fontes, with the occasional help and input from several colleagues.
